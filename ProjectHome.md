Andiparos is a fork of the famous [Paros Proxy](http://www.parosproxy.org). It is an open source web application security assessment tool that gives penetration testers the ability to spider websites, analyze content, intercept and modify requests, etc.

The advantage of Andiparos is mainly the support of Client Certificates on Smartcards. Moreover it has several small interface enhancements, making the life easier for penetration testers...

Features:

  * Smartcard support
  * BeanShell support
  * History Filter (URLs)
  * Passive Scanner
  * Advanced search functionality
  * MultiTags for request/response
  * Mark Request/Response
  * Better Mac OS X integration
  * other nice enhancements...

For stability reasons, JDIC support has been completely removed.

As already mentioned, Andiparos can be seen as Paros Proxy plus some minor enhancements. All credits for the Proxy tool go to [Chinotec Technologies Co](http://www.parosproxy.org).

Andiparos is supported on Mac OS X, Linux and Windows environments.

**We are looking forward for your valuable feedback. Please also consider telling us your feature wishes!**


Note: The ZAP Attack Proxy project and the Andiparos project have joined forces. Andiparos features will be integrated into [ZAP Attack Proxy](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project) in the course of time. Whilst new features will be integrated into ZAP, there might be updates of Andiparos focusing on the stability of the tool.
